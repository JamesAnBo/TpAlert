# TpAlert
FFXI Ashita v4 addon. Audible alerts when chosen party members gain 1k+ TP.

Dumb little addon because my laziness and lack of attention span knows no bounds.

TpAlert makes an audible alert when chosen party members reach 1k+ TP.
only works with your own party.
you can track multiple members at once. Including yourself.

```
/tpa add <name> -add a emmeber to track.
/tpa reset -reset tracked members list
/tpa list -print tracked members list
/tpa sound -toggle sound on/off
/tpa sound <1-7> -select sound
/tpa messeges -turn chat messages on/off
```
